# PyPoll Challenge

## Overview of Project

Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, requested my assistance in an election audit of the 
tabulated results of the U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. I was tasked with reporting the total 
number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each 
candidate, the winner of the election based on the popular vote, the voter turnout for each county, the 
percentage of votes from each county of the total count and the county with the highest voter turnout. I 
used Python to automate the process and the resulting code could be used for used to audit not only other 
congressional districts but also senatorial districts and local elections. </p>

## Election-Audit Results:
The election-audit report is provided below:

	-------------------------

	County Votes:
	Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
	-------------------------
	Largest County Turnout Denver
	-------------------------
	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
	-------------------------
	Winner: Diana DeGette
	Winning Vote Count: 272,892
	Winning Percentage: 73.8%
	-------------------------

## Election-Audit Summary
Tom and I successfully built and implemented Python code that automated an election audit, converting 
a manual Excel process into a repeatable process. I propose that the Election Commission authorize the 
use of our code to audit other congressional districts and senatorial districts and local elections. The 
code can be modified to be used for other elections. This would include changing the breakdown by 
counties to a breakdown required for senatorial districts and for local elections. This would also include 
changing the code to allow for the opening and reading of csv files that would contain the data for the 
other elections.
